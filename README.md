## The orginial project:
This is just a fork of the original project: https://github.com/AdamKatona/mocha-autotest

## Prerequisites for this project:
- NodeJS (at least v6 with npm 3)
- VS Code IDE

# Installing and starting the project:
_~From command line/terminal_
- npm install
- npm test

**For creating VS Code project and apply configs** used by me in the IDE, run install.cmd
For generating an install.cmd from your own configs, use the following command line script (without the quotes):
"_for /F "tokens=*" %i in ('code --list-extensions') do @echo call code --install-extension %i >> install.cmd_"

_Make sure it is inserted as a single line (and remove erroneus lines if any, by editing the .cmd file)_

**ALSO you can use Settings Sync plugin for VS Code (See link for exact description)**
